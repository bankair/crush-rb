Welcome to **Crush-rb** â€“ the ultimate file compression tool designed to shave off those extra bytes and streamline your archiving process!

Crush-rb is a powerful command line utility that compresses files in three different formats: **gzip**, **bzip2**, and **xz**. After compressing your files, Crush-rb automatically selects and retains the smallest compressed file, ensuring that you always save maximum space with minimal effort.

Whether you're dealing with large datasets, backing up essential files, or simply optimizing your storage, Crush-rb is your go-to solution for efficient file compression.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Compression Formats:** Supports gzip, bzip2, and xz.
- **Automated Optimization:** Keeps only the smallest compressed file.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on Linux and macOS (Windows support untested).

## Installation

Getting started with Crush-rb is a breeze. Simply install the gem via RubyGems:

```sh

```

## Usage

Using Crush-rb is straightforward. Here's a quick example to get you started:

```sh
crush path/to/the/directory/you/want/to/compress
```

Crush-rb will compress your files using gzip, bzip2, and xz, then retain the smallest resulting file, providing you with optimal compression effortlessly.


Ex:

```sh
$ crush huge_directory
huge_directory.tar.xz
$
```

For its full usage:

* The data you'd like to compress is super small
* You already have a good idea of the kind of compression that will perform the best
